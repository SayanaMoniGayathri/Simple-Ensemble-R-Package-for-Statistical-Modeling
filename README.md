Objective: Developed an R package for statistical modeling encompassing linear, logistic, ridge, lasso, and elastic net regression, along with SVM, random forest, or boosted trees for binary and continuous response variables.

Project Involves: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on large predictor sets, implemented pre-screening for top predictors, and utilized "bagging" techniques for model robustness. Integrated ensemble learning to combine model outputs.

Skills Demonstrated:

Statistical Modeling: Implemented multiple regression techniques and machine learning models.
Software Development: Created a user-friendly R package with comprehensive documentation and sample code.
Data Analysis: Conducted EDA, feature selection, and model evaluation.
